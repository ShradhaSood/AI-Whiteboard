***AI Whiteboard***

This is a computer vision project that allows users to draw on a screen by waving their hands in the air. The project uses OpenCV and Python to detect the color of the user's hand and track its movement. The user can then draw by moving their hand in the air, and the lines will be drawn on the screen.

This project is a fun and creative way to use computer vision. It can be used for a variety of purposes, such as drawing, painting, and even playing games. The project is also relatively easy to build, making it a good choice for beginners who want to learn about computer vision.

Here is the algorithm for building an air canvas using OpenCV and Python:

1. Start reading the frames from a webcam.

2. Convert the captured frames to HSV color space. This is because HSV color space is better suited for color detection than RGB color space.

3. Create a canvas window. This is where the user will draw their images.

4. Adjust the trackbar values for finding the mask of the colored marker. The trackbar values control the lower and upper bounds of the color range that will be considered as the marker.

5. Preprocess the mask with morphological operations. This helps to remove noise from the mask and improve the accuracy of the detection.

6. Detect the contours in the mask. A contour is a group of connected pixels that have the same color. The largest contour is the one that corresponds to the marker.

7. Find the center coordinates of the largest contour. These coordinates will be used to draw the image on the canvas.

8. Draw the image on the canvas. The image is drawn as a series of points, starting from the center coordinates and extending outwards.


The following are the requirements for this project:
Python 3
NumPy
OpenCV

Here are some additional tips:

1. Use a bright colored marker that contrasts with the background. This will make it easier to detect the marker in the frames.

2. Place the webcam in a well-lit area. This will also help to improve the accuracy of the detection.

3. Experiment with the trackbar values to find the best settings for your marker.

4. You can also use other morphological operations to improve the accuracy of the detection, such as opening and closing.
